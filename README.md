## FASTAPI

<p>FastAPI is a modern, high-performance, and easy-to-use web framework for building APIs with Python. It leverages asynchronous programming capabilities, enabling efficient handling of concurrent requests, and provides automatic generation of interactive API documentation through OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards. FastAPI's intuitive and type-safe approach, utilizing Python type hints, facilitates rapid development and validation of APIs while ensuring data integrity. It also offers robust support for dependency injection, authentication, and authorization mechanisms, making it a versatile choice for developing scalable and efficient web applications.</p>

#### Advantages of using FAST Api :

- High Performance
- Rapid Development
- Type Safety
- Automatic API Documentation
- Dependency Injection
- Authentication and Authorization
- Pythonic and Familiar
- Scalability
- Extensible
- Community and Documentation

While FastAPI is a powerful and versatile web framework, there are certain scenarios where it might not be the best fit.

<p>If you are building a simple static website website with minimal dynamic functionality using FastApi might be overkill, in such cases a mroe lightweight and tradition al web framework like Flask or stati site generator could be better choice.</p>
<p>
If you are working in a existing project with  large codebase build with different framework, switching into fastApi might be headache in some cases.</p>

<p>If your program donot need asunchronous programming then it is not best to use.  For very small project or project with limiged lifespan , the additional featurea and capabilities of FastApi might not be necessary. and there are many of the cases like this where the fastApi may not be the optimal choice.</p>
